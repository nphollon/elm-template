# elm-template

This is a basic template for a new Elm project. It includes a script for running unit tests from the command line.

If you are building an HTML app, you can probably replace the contents of src/Main.elm with a call to [evancz/startapp](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/start-app/2.0.1).
